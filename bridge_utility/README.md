# Apparel Design Bridge Utility

This desktop application runs on your local machine and automates Adobe Illustrator to process apparel design instructions from the web application.

## 🎯 What It Does

- Connects to the web application and polls for pending design jobs
- Downloads template .ai files from cloud storage
- Controls Adobe Illustrator via scripting to manipulate layers
- Applies logos, colors, text, and other customizations based on instructions
- Generates exports in multiple formats (.ai, .svg, .pdf, .png)
- Uploads generated files back to the web application

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Required Software

1. **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
   - Download from: https://nodejs.org/
   - Verify installation: `node --version`

2. **Adobe Illustrator** (CC 2020 or later recommended)
   - Must be installed and licensed on your machine
   - Note the installation path (needed for configuration)

### System Requirements

- **Windows 10/11** or **macOS 10.15+**
- At least 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
- 2GB free disk space for temporary files

## 🚀 Installation

### Step 1: Download the Bridge Utility

1. Download the entire `bridge_utility` folder from the project
2. Place it in a convenient location on your computer (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\apparel-bridge` on Windows or `~/apparel-bridge` on Mac)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Bridge Connects to Localhost Instead of Deployed URL

**Problem:** Bridge tries to connect to `http://localhost:3000` instead of your deployed web app.

**Root Cause:** The `.env` file doesn't exist or isn't being read.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check if `.env` exists:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/bridge_utility
   ls -la | grep .env
   ```
   You should see both `.env.example` AND `.env`

2. **If `.env` is missing, create it:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
3. **Edit `.env` and set the correct URL:**
   ```env
   WEB_APP_URL=https://eira-designs.abacusai.app
   ```
   
4. **Make sure there are no spaces around `=`**
   - ✅ Correct: `WEB_APP_URL=https://eira-designs.abacusai.app`
   - ❌ Wrong: `WEB_APP_URL = https://eira-designs.abacusai.app`

5. **Restart the bridge:**
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

6. **Verify the bridge is reading the file:**
   When the bridge starts, you should see:
   ```
   📍 Web App URL: https://eira-designs.abacusai.app
   👤 User Email: john@doe.com
   ```
   If you see `http://localhost:3000`, the `.env` file isn't being read.

### ".env file not found" Error

**Problem:** Bridge displays "❌ ERROR: .env file not found!"

**Solutions:**
- You haven't created the `.env` file yet
- Run `cp .env.example .env` in the bridge_utility directory
- Make sure you're in the correct directory when running the bridge

### Authentication Fails

**Problem:** "❌ Authentication error: 401 Unauthorized"

**Solutions:**
- Verify your email and password in `.env` are correct
- Make sure you can log in to the web app with these credentials
- Check that `WEB_APP_URL` is correct (should be the deployed URL, not localhost)

### Illustrator Not Found

**Problem:** "❌ Illustrator script error: Cannot find Illustrator"

**Solutions:**
- Verify `ILLUSTRATOR_PATH` in `.env` is correct
- Make sure Adobe Illustrator is installed
- Try running Illustrator manually to ensure it's working

### Script Execution Fails

**Problem:** Illustrator opens but script doesn't run

**Solutions:**
- **Windows:** Ensure you're running Command Prompt as Administrator
- **macOS:** Grant Terminal accessibility permissions:
  1. System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy
  2. Select "Automation" in left sidebar
  3. Enable Terminal to control Adobe Illustrator

### Template Download Fails

**Problem:** "❌ Download error"

**Solutions:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify the web app is running and accessible
- Ensure template files were uploaded correctly in the web app

### No Jobs Found

**Problem:** Bridge runs but no jobs are processed

**Solutions:**
- Create a design item in the web app
- Add design instructions to the item
- Verify the instruction status is "pending"
- Check that polling is enabled in `config.json`

## 📁 File Structure

```

## 🎨 How It Works

### Workflow

1. **Poll for Jobs:** Bridge checks web app every 5 seconds for pending design instructions
2. **Download Template:** Fetches the .ai template file from cloud storage
3. **Parse Instructions:** Converts natural language instructions into structured data
4. **Execute Script:** Runs ExtendScript in Adobe Illustrator to manipulate layers
5. **Apply Changes:**
   - Place logos at specified positions
   - Add text (team names, player names, etc.)
   - Apply team colors to layers
   - Add manufacturer logo
6. **Generate Exports:** Save as .ai, .svg, .pdf, .png
7. **Upload Results:** Send generated files back to web app
8. **Update Status:** Mark job as completed

### Layer Manipulation

The Illustrator script:
- Finds or creates layers based on element names
- Clears existing content
- Places images (logos) at specified positions
- Adds text with formatting
- Applies colors to specific layers
- Positions elements based on instructions (top left, center, bottom right, etc.)

### Supported Instructions

The script can interpret:
- **Logo placement:** "Put GT logo on top left"
- **Text placement:** "Player name on back"
- **Manufacturer logo:** "Manufacturer logo bottom right"
- **Colors:** Automatically applies team colors to designated layers
- **Multiple variations:** Can process multiple placements in one job

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` file to version control
- Keep your credentials secure
- The bridge only communicates with your specified web app
- Temporary files are cleaned up automatically

## 🆘 Getting Help

### Check Logs

The bridge outputs detailed logs to the console. If something fails:
1. Check the console output for error messages
2. Look for specific error codes or messages
3. Verify all prerequisites are met

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Bridge won't start | Check Node.js installation, run `npm install` |
| Can't authenticate | Verify credentials in `.env` |
| Illustrator errors | Check Illustrator path, ensure it's licensed |
| Upload fails | Check internet connection, verify web app URL |
| Files not generated | Check Illustrator script permissions |

## 🔄 Updating

To update the bridge utility:
1. Download the new version
2. Replace `index.js` and `illustrator-script.jsx`
3. Check for new configuration options in `config.json`
4. Restart the bridge

## 💡 Tips

- **Keep it running:** Leave the bridge running in a terminal window while designing
- **Monitor output:** Watch the console for errors or issues
- **Test templates:** Start with simple designs to verify everything works
- **Multiple machines:** Install the bridge on multiple computers for distributed processing
- **Background process:** On Windows, use `npm install -g pm2` then `pm2 start index.js` to run as background service

## 📝 Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
npm install --save-dev nodemon
npm run dev
```

This will auto-restart the bridge when you make code changes.

### Modifying the Illustrator Script

The `illustrator-script.jsx` file uses Adobe ExtendScript. Key functions:

- `processInstructions()` - Main processing logic
- `processPlacement()` - Handle individual placements
- `placeLogo()` - Place image files
- `addText()` - Add text elements
- `applyColors()` - Apply team colors
- `exportDocument()` - Generate exports

### Testing

1. Create a test design in the web app
2. Add simple instructions like "Put logo on top left"
3. Monitor bridge console output
4. Check generated files in `output/` folder
5. Verify files appear in web app
